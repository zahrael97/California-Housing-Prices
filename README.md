# California-Housing-Prices
This is the First project From the book  Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by GÃ©ron


This dataset was based on data from the 1990 California census. It is not exactly recent (you could
still afford a nice house in the Bay Area at the time), but it has many qualities for learning, so we will
pretend it is recent data. We also added a categorical attribute and removed a few features for teaching
purposes.
