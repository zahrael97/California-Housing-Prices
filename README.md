# California-Housing-Prices
This is My First project From the book  Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Géron


This dataset was based on data from the 1990 California census. It is not exactly recent (you could
still afford a nice house in the Bay Area at the time), but it has many qualities for learning, so we will
pretend it is recent data. We also added a categorical attribute and removed a few features for teaching
purposes.

Look at the Big Picture


Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation! The first task you are asked to perform is to build a
model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the
population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block
groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block
group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.
Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district,
given all the other metrics.
